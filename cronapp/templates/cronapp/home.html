   <p>If you want to periodically perform a task (e.g. sending Emails, backing up database, doing regular maintenance, etc.) at specified times and dates, there are two ways to set scheduled tasks:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Method 1: Use our online cron job service that will save you a headache.</li>
   <li>Method 2: Use Cron available in Unix/Linux systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you go with method 2, the following generator can help you produce a crontab syntax that you can copy & paste to your crontab file (You can open the file by using command crontab â€“e). Below the generated crontab syntax, a list of run times will be displayed too. The predictions will help you ensure that you set the time and date right.</p>
